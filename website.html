        <p>My Dearest Mukichuki,</p>
        <p>I realise how much just these three months has made me liking to love you in a way that i could never imagine i can. You are that golden person to me you are just so bright the happiest thing in my life.  </p>
        <p> You are someone that i can never imagine that i can have. You are a man of your words, and now to call you maine is just feels so unreal. Will take meabput a year lol, cause i really got the finest man someone can ever have. We have had days where i have been an lil emotional ass and haven't been on my best behaviour yet you have always been so caring, selfless, so full of love. You are just so patient, from all that you've gone through i just wan to love you as much as i can in this lifetime. </p>
        <p>From the way you smile to the sound of your laughter, those beautiful eyes that just is so unreal and every little thing about you makes my heart skip a beat. I just wanna say that whatever comes in life, however miserable we are at any stage of life i'd always be there right beside you.  </p>
        <p>And us is forever, you made me belive that the boy that i have always wanted and asked from god to exists. And knowing you i just feel so blessed that i have someone even better than what i have wanted and i literally couldn't dream of having. 
          </p>
        <p> 
          So, let me tell you again you are my baby & only mine.</p>
